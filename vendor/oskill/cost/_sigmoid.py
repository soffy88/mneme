"""Sigmoid market impact model for crypto perpetual and spot markets.

Saturates at max_impact_bps as participation → 1.
Smooth derivative (no kink at p=0 like sqrt law).
Vol-adjusted: high-vol assets have a lower half-saturation point
(they attract more impact per unit participation).

    Parameters
    ----------
    notional_usd:
        Order size in USD.
    daily_volume_usd:
        Average daily volume of the instrument in USD.
        Floored at 1e6 to avoid division by near-zero on illiquid assets.
    realized_vol_30d:
        30-day realized annualised volatility (e.g. 0.6 = 60%).
        Scales the half-saturation participation point k:
        low-vol (BTC ~0.4) → k≈0.05; high-vol (1.5+) → k≈0.013.
    max_impact_bps:
        Asymptotic ceiling in basis points as participation → 1.
    **_extra:
        Absorbs legacy YAML params (sigmoid_center, sigmoid_scale) silently.

    Returns
