    Workflow:
        1. Extract candidate['content'] texts
        2. Call reranker_fn(query, texts) -> list[float]
        3. Attach 'reranker_score' to each candidate dict (copy)
        4. Sort descending by reranker_score (stable sort preserves original order on ties)
        5. Filter by top_k and/or score_threshold
        6. Return reranked list

    Parameters
    ----------
    query : str
        Search query.
    candidates : list[dict]
        Candidate documents, each with a 'content' key.
    reranker_fn : callable
        (query, texts) -> list[float] scoring function.
    top_k : int or None
        Return at most top_k results.
    score_threshold : float or None
        Exclude results with reranker_score below this threshold.
    preserve_original_order_on_ties : bool
        If True, use a stable sort to preserve original order among tied scores.

    Returns
    -------
    list of candidate dicts with 'reranker_score' field added, sorted by score.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If len(reranker_fn output) != len(candidates).
