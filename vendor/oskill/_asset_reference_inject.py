"""K-asset_reference_inject: inject asset references into shot_spec (injection pattern).

Layer4 (hevi) owns the asset DB. oskill only does the mechanical injection:
  - resolve each ref ID via asset_loader (if provided)
  - merge resolved asset data into shot_spec under standardized keys
  - asset_loader=None → skip loading, inject raw ref IDs as-is (staging/dry-run)
