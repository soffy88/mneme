    """Ensemble multiple signal streams into a single signal.

    Mathematical definition:
        For each timestamp t:
            raw_score_t = aggregation_method(
                {name: signal[t] * weight[name] for name in signals}
            )
            decayed_score_t = raw_score_t * decay_fn(t_lag)  # if decay_fn given
            final_score_t = clip(decayed_score_t, -1, 1)

    Aggregation methods:
        linear:    sum(w_i * s_i) / sum(w_i)
        geometric: prod((s_i + 1)^w_i)^(1/sum(w_i)) - 1  (for signals in [-1, 1])
        harmonic:  1 / sum(w_i / s_i)  (for non-zero signals)

    Decay:
        If decay_fn is provided, apply multiplier at each position t.
        If decay_fn is None and decay_lookback > 0, uses linear decay:
            weight_t = max(0, 1 - t_lag / decay_lookback)
        decay_fn signature: (lag: int) -> float, where lag=0 = most recent.

    Returns aggregated signal of same length as input signals, clipped to [-1, 1].
    Output type matches the first signal's type (ndarray or pd.Series with same index).

    Parameters
    ----------
    signals : dict
        Map of signal_name -> time-aligned array/Series, ideally in [-1, 1].
    weights : dict
        Non-negative weight per signal. Must contain all keys from signals.
    decay_fn : callable or None
        Optional (lag: int) -> float multiplier. Applied to output at each t.
    decay_lookback : int
        If > 0 and decay_fn is None, uses linear decay over lookback bars.
    aggregation : {'linear', 'geometric', 'harmonic'}
        Aggregation method.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray or pd.Series clipped to [-1, 1].

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If signals have mismatched lengths, weights are invalid, or
        weights dict doesn't cover all signal keys.
