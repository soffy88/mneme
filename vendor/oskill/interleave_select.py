    The algorithm:
    1. Sort questions by priority score (lowest mastery + appropriate difficulty first).
    2. Greedily select the next highest-priority question that doesn't share
       kc_id with the last selected item.
    3. If no valid next question exists (all remaining have the same kc_id
       as the last), move to the next best available from a different kc.

    ----------
