    """Detect hidden market regimes in *features* using a Gaussian HMM.

    If *trained_model* is provided the Baum-Welch fit is skipped and only
    Viterbi decoding is performed.  This allows applying a model trained on
    historical data to new observations without re-fitting.

    Composites used:
        1. oprim.hmm_baum_welch — fits the emission and transition parameters.
        2. oprim.hmm_viterbi   — decodes the most-likely state sequence.

    Args:
        features: 1-D or 2-D array-like of shape (T,) or (T, D).
        n_regimes: Number of hidden regimes.
        trained_model: Pre-fitted model dict (output of hmm_baum_welch).
            When None the model is fitted from *features*.
        max_iter: EM iteration cap (used only when fitting).
        random_state: Seed for reproducibility (used only when fitting).

    Returns:
        Dict with keys:

        - ``regimes`` – List of integer regime labels, length T.
        - ``model``   – Fitted model dict (pass back as *trained_model*).
        - ``n_regimes`` – Number of regimes.
        - ``current_regime`` – Regime label of the last observation.
        - ``transition_matrix`` – n_regimes × n_regimes transition matrix.
